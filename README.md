# Flask-App
Flask, a Python microframework, enables rapid development of web apps and APIs. It offers core routing and request handling, using Jinja2 for templating and Werkzeug for WSGI. Its lean, extensible design allows developers to add needed features (e.g., DBs, forms) for scalable solutions.
